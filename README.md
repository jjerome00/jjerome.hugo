## How To

Make a link that opens in a new tab, without the markdown freaking out:
```
<a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/vOlcW/" target="`_blank`"> `https://imgur.com/gallery/vOlcW`</a>
```
*  target="`_blank`" keeps the markdown formatter from freaking out
* if you are going to show a url in the text, then surround it by ````
