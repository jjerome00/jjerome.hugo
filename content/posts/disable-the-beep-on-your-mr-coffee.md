<h1>Silencing your Mr Coffee FTX21 (or FTX25) for good</h1>
<p>After 9 years, I finally had enough of the loud beeping coming from my Mr Coffee. Like most things, it started out small and built up until I couldn't take it anymore. I often wish these things like this had an option for a mute button, but it’s not the
  case. </p>
<p>All my research just turned up others complaining about the same problem for their unit, which was comforting but didn’t solve the problem. The following link got me started on the solution I came up with:
  <br /><a href="http://mongolianquill.net/2011/10/disable-the-obnoxious-beeping-on-a-mr-coffee-model-jwx27/" target="_blank">Disable the obnoxious beeping on a Mr. Coffee, Model JWX27</a></p>
<p>I thought it might be a clever idea to just find the speaker and disable it. The coffee maker could continue going about its business and never make a noise again. I had tried taking the coffee maker apart a few times. The only success that I’ve had is
  that I got it back together (and working) each time. I discovered that the electronic components (circuit board) are sealed inside the machine. That’s probably a good idea considering how much moisture it deals with on a daily basis. </p>
<p>However, I didn’t give up, and this last time proved to be the charm. I brewed a few test-cups and listened to determine the location of the speaker inside the unit. My wife walked into the kitchen and saw me with my ear against the coffee maker, and
  didn’t even flinch. On our wedding day I told her that the only thing I could promise is that I'd make her laugh. Every time she catches me in a situation like this she just says "I see you are keeping your promise alive and well". </p>
<p>After I determined the spot, I carefully drilled a pencil-width hole into that spot. To my luck I discovered there was some space between the outer wall and the circuit board. This allowed me to drill a couple more holes (3 total) to get a better look.
  I was considering using a dremel, but I wanted to keep my holes as small as possible to make it easier to fix when I was finished. </p>
<p>I discovered a circular disc directly below where I drilled the holes - this was the speaker! While it was beeping, I poked it with a screwdriver and the sound fluctuated with my prodding. To finish the job, I brewed another test pot and while it was
  beeping I carefully pried the disc away from the circuit board until the machine fell silent. </p>
<p>No more beeping! I feel both ecstatic and lame at the same time! </p>
<p>My only hope is that this inspires more people to take ownership of their electronics. Also, keep in mind that there are plenty of good coffee machines for sale at your local Goodwill. Good Luck! </p>
