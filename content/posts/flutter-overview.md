I gave a Tech Talk at my company, GenUI.  It's a lightweight overview, with a short discussion afterwords.  

I learned Flutter for an assignment for a client who wanted to explore Flutter for a project they had in mind.  They wanted someone with knowledge of iOS, Android, and anything else that might come up.

You can view the presentation below.

## Retrospective

Learning Flutter was a lot of fun! Since then I've been on a few native mobile projects.  There are times I feel that Flutter might have made a lot of sense for them.  I hope to get the chance to use Flutter again in the future.

I also wrote a small demo of a validating DropDown widget for Flutter.  You can view it at my github page:

I should note that I had to put this together on short notice.  I would have liked to have the demo a little more hashed out.
