After nearly seven
months (7 months!) since my final project for my Android program was completed, I have released it onto the app store. Introducing (formally)... <b>One Book Away</b>!
<br />
<br />Go install it now at the Google Play store:
<br /><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mabon.onebook" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mabon.onebook</a>
<br />
<br />If you like it, please leave a glowing review!

<h4>Now for some questions that no one is asking...</h4>
<br /><b>Where did this idea come from?</b>
<br />The idea for this app came to me a few years ago when I was trying to organize things I was waiting for at the library. &nbsp;After placing holds on a few popular books or movies, I found they seemed to come all at the same time! &nbsp;So I came up with
a way to estimate how long I would have to wait for books and movies.
<br />
<br />Originally, I thought it would be a greasemonkey script. &nbsp;The only reason I decided to use Android was that I needed a project for my Android class and I couldn't think of anything else. &nbsp;The first app was just a manual-entry calculator, but
as I learned about the platform it grew into a full-blown useful app.
<br />
<br />Some past iterations of the app:

</ul>
<br /><b>Why did it take 7 months?</b>
<br />One of my instructors gave the advice to build something that you would find useful, then after building it decide if it would be useful to others. &nbsp;At the very least you get something you find useful for the work you put in. &nbsp;However, I ran
into the problem of the app working well enough for me, so I wasn't as motivated to finish polishing it. &nbsp;On top of that, I was only putting in about 1 day a week, and if a major issue arose it might take me 2 weeks to find a good solution.
<br />
<br /><b>What's your status?</b>
<br />I'm a full-time contractor, so I was looking for something to do on the side for fun. &nbsp;I don't do any advertising for my apps, and I feel if I was ever going to look to do this more seriously it would be beneficial to me to keep publishing apps.
<br
/>
<br /><b>What got you into Android development?</b>
<br />I did some robotics development a few years ago that I very much liked. &nbsp;The same bug that might render a web page incorrectly might cause your robot to turn left and run off the table. &nbsp;Android development reminded me of that past, so I wanted
to explore it further.
<br />
<br /><b>What do you think of Android development?</b>
<br />I've been on a c++ project for a few years, so getting back into Java was a little strange. &nbsp;I don't like development that gets in my way, and I want it to be straight forward and just work. &nbsp;Some parts are very nice, especially the xml files
for the layout and strings. &nbsp;Other parts I'm not so hot on, like the amount of code it takes to do what appears to be a simple task.
<br />
<br />It took a while to get used to Eclipse coming from the easy debugging style of Visual Studio. &nbsp;I switched to Android Studio as soon as I could, but in hindsight I think I should have waited until it was more stable. &nbsp;In a lot of ways Android
Studio held me up the most.
<br />
<br /><b>What's next?</b>
<br />Believe it or not, I have 2-3 more ideas I'm eager to start on. &nbsp;I'd also like to work with someone fun to help keep the project moving, and keep it from being such a lonely process.
