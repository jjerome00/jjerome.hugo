<h1>I somehow developed a hobby of creating Simpsons pictures for my family.</h1>
<p>I have this ongoing hobby of creating Simpsons pictures for myself and family. It started out as a joke, and it just continued from there. I just created a new one the other day, and I thought I should try to keep some sort of a record of some of them.
  </p>
<p>This pre-dates most social media sites. In fact, the original reason was to make chat icons for my IM client (Pidgin). I suppose as web technology improved and the avatars got bigger, so did the complexity of my alterations. After each one I think it
  will be the last, only to find myself thinking of new ideas a short time later. </p>
<p>All of these were made using <a href="http://gimp.org" target="_blank">GIMP</a> (for Windows).</p>
