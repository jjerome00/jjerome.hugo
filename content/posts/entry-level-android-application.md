I've been taking a series of classes on Android development in my spare time via UW.&nbsp; The final project for my 1st class was to build a simple 2-screen application and present it in front of the class.
<br />
<br />Lucky for me the presentation was recorded.&nbsp; Un-lucky for me it was recorded using Adobe Connect, which makes downloading and editing the video extremely annoying.&nbsp; I figured a way around all the hurdles and you can watch the video below.&nbsp;
I've also posted the slides below with some notes.
<br />

<br />Some quick notes:
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Originally I was going to made a tip calculator, but was talked into this idea instead</li>
  <li>The idea for this app came from an idea I had for a Greasemonkey script</li>
</ul>
<br />

<br />Slide 1
<br />
<ul>
  <li>The presentation was meant to be mostly verbal with just a few points made on the slides themselves.&nbsp; However, I did modify a couple for this blog post. </li>
</ul>
<br />

<br />Slide 2
<br />
<ul>
  <li>A simple feature allows me to explore the entire end-to-end process </li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />

<br />Slide 3
<br />
<ul>
  <li>The first example is simple to allow the audience to quickly follow the gist of the calculation</li>
  <li>The second example shows how the result can be useful: with a 5 month wait, I can plan to read something else while I'm waiting </li>
</ul>

<br />Slide 4
<br />
<ul>
  <li>The better looking app usually wins</li>
  <li>I found this image of an old-style library checkout card to use as a guide (my apologies if this is your image)</li>
</ul>

<br />Slide 5
<br />
<ul>
  <li>For the actual presentation, I switched to using a separate overhead projector that displayed my phone on the wall.&nbsp; I just inserted a screenshot for this version.</li>
</ul>

<br />Slide 6
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Process button wasn't needed, but works as a visual cue to the user</li>
  <li>I used View elements in the XML layout, with a height/width of 1dip to make the lines</li>
  <li>I repeated those lines at the bottom to complete the look I was trying to achieve</li>
  <li>If I had to do this again, I would calculate the device's resolution and repeat those lines as many times as I needed.&nbsp; It didn't matter for this project.</li>
</ul>

<br />Slide 7
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Changing Preferences wasn't supposed to overwrite the current values the user had entered, but upon testing this just confused the user.&nbsp; I had to change it to just have the preferences always over-write the current values.</li>
  <li>I originally had the result displayed in a TextView (read only), but decided to change it to a EditView so the user could select and copy the result</li>
  <li>The font and background with smudges made a HUGE difference. Smudges were just in the background image I created in GIMP, the aspect ratio didn't matter.</li>
  <li>I don't think anyone noticed, but I used that same background image in the app for this slide. I wanted to show that the image could be re-sized to fit just about anything and still look realistic.</li>
</ul>

<br />Slide 8
<br />
<ul>
  <li>If you didn't watch the video, the audience had a couple questions and comments about how I did a couple things </li>
  <li>The comment that I remember most was when someone commented on the background image - he said at first he thought the screen on my phone was dirty!&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
