I have been making a constant effort to share more code, and be more open with my thoughts.  I want to embrace feedback from others rather than fear it.  This site tries to reflect that notion.

I'm a serial hobbyist.  I use writing to express my thoughts, and I'm a fan of art and design.  I love technology, life, pets, kids, and coffee.  I especially love when these things mix together in interesting ways.
